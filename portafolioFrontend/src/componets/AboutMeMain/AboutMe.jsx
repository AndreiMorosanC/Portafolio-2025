          Hi, I’m Andrei. Nice to meet you.
        </h2>

          Since beginning my journey into web development, I’ve focused on
          learning full-stack technologies, building real-world projects, and
          refining my skills day by day. I enjoy turning ideas into clean,
          functional code — always looking for new challenges to grow,
          collaborate, and create tools that make an impact.
